I‚Äôd love to get together sometime.

This morning Â on 2 train.

Â I beleave you get on a train at 125th.

You: Â you'd tall Â black man in Â white shirt Â blue jeans and brown shoes.

Â You have big black ombrela in your hands and I think you have a big cook man I can see that.

Â   You are gorgeous man.

Â   If you see this email me.

Andabas con tu amiga, ibas de camino para Brooklyn porque querÃ­as cruzar el puente caminando.

Eres bella, de EspaÃ±a, una humildad en tu corazÃ³n.

Hablamos de las opciones que podÃ­as hacer.

Espero que te hayas dado cuenta que iba a poner este mensaje aquÃ­.

T'Ã©tais avec deux amis et t'as commandÃ© deux cafÃ©s, un pour toi un autre pour ton pote.

Je crois que je t'ai croisÃ© Ã  Paris il y a deux ans quand j'Ã©tais Ã  l'universitÃ© mais j'en suis pas sÃ»r.

Si t'es en train de lire ce message je veux bien te parler on peut prendre un cafÃ© ou quelque chose comme Ã§a si tu veux.

T'en fais pas, mon franÃ§ais est aussi bien que mon anglais ;).

This morning Â I got on 2train in 42st.

Â   You: black man in your 20s Â in black wind pants ans white t-shirt.

Â   Then you got off the train at chambers st.

Was around Â 7:40 this morning.

Â   If you see this, I like to talk to you.

This morning, we both got on 3 downtown train around 7:20Â   You: in red shorts, red sneakers and Â white t-shirt.

Â I take a look at you playing with you cellphone but time to time you looking at me.

Â We both got off the train at 42 st.

Â You were wearing a green-ish tank & black stretch pants.

Â     If interested respond with what I was wearing so I know it's you.

Â .

Today around Â 1:30 you come to theÂ   Beauty supply and ask me to help you looking for apricot soap.

Then I help you and pass by you Â and my hand touch you.

Â   You: young black man in shorts and white t-shirt.

Â     Since then I see you now and then around Brooklyn heights and usually, by the time I work up the nerve to say 'hello', you've either disappeared inside of a building, or you're several blocks away ( not that I would mind walking the few blocks, but if I'm going to chase you down, I feel I should have more to say than 'hello').

Â     If, by some small chance, you happen to find this, I'd love to finally buy you coffee (or something to keep you cool).

7:24pm on downtown N train fromÂ AstoriaÂ     You just got off at 34th st Harold Sq.

Â I caught you looking at me also a few times.

Â You brown skin and beautiful dark hair and eyebrows.

Â You seem casual in a striped shirt and grey slacks and some sporty shoes.

Â Sketchers maybe.

Â Me jeans and black T.

Â Of course "I never do this on Craigslist", Â but I guess it's easier than approaching a stranger on the subway.

Â I'd love to meet.

Perhaps I'm just naÃ¯ve.

Â .

Â Was there a connection.

Â Hit me back and tell me what I saw when u walked by.

Â .

From then on you Â caught me smiling at you.

Â     My friends have told me that if I see an adorable girl on the train I should spill my coffee on her.

Â     So I decided against that.

Â     So here is my hope you see this.

Â     Oh and if you are currently seeing someone you should remind them how lucky he/she is.

Â     But in the unlikely event you are single and you would like to meet for coffee, I promise not to spill it on you, just let me know.

Â     Also, I have a cute dog.

Â .

I met you in a outside cafÃ© in Larchmont you invited me to come to the waterfront I was waiting to see my Accountant, I regret not taking you up on the offer, I cannot stop thinking about you, your father Holocaust survivor, get in touch soon.

Â I've never written a Craig's list before but for you I make an exception.

Â    .

Today around Â 1:30 you come to theÂ   Beauty supply and ask me to help you looking for apricot soap.

Then I help you and pass by you Â and my hand touch you.

Â   If you see this, I like to talk to you.

Soy lesbiana,soltera,sin hijos y sin compromiso,estable emocionalmente y econÃ³micamente.

No me interesa lo fÃ­sico ,me enfoco mas en lo que me pueda ofrecer tu corazÃ³n y mente.

Si quieres contactarme, cuÃ©ntame algo de ti y si quieres me mandas una foto.

Busco a Luis Angel "Cholo" Rosado, 38 aÃ±os, hispano, con tatuajes en los dos brazos, vive en el Bronx, y lo vieron en la 175 y Grand Concouse el 7/16/12.

And I try to wipe over the largest dramas with the most ill-timed outrageous jokes, and bogus self-narratives, and random gloats with this alien droll "maÃ®tre d'" tone.

I'd avoid clichÃ©s, but you have a great smile.

Â   What muesli is.

Â   That I don't care if you fall asleep during my favorite movie.

Â   Your mom farted on our words with friend game.

Â   Winston likes you too.

Â     That had I not seen you last Friday I would have Â met you Saturday or Sunday or Monday.

You arenÂ´t, but you are smart.

"    "hell no," my vocal chords vibrate through a smile, "you're talking smack about my clichÃ©.

brushing her fingers over the flimsy papers she whispers, "yeah, but it's a wonderful clichÃ©.

Let us knowÂ .

You sound like an awkward mix of an extremely bitter, sad and naÃ¯ve woman trapped in a teenage girl's mind that's been getting everything handed to her your whole life.

1 Corinthians 13:4-7  New International Version (NIV)  4Â Love is patient, love is kind.

5Â It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.

6Â Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

7Â It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Â     I think Craigslist is for pervs and it's not like these things EVER help you find your missed connections.

Â     You: Tall.

Â     Me: 5'2", black hair, Riverdales shirt, black Chucks, black jeans with a hole in the ass pocket.

Â     ////////////////////////////////    So basically, I was bored as shit last Friday, and by bored I mean broke.

Â     As much as I wanted to go to a show more suited to my tastes (meaning NOT SHIT,) well, I couldn't (re: broke).

Â     You know.

Â     Okay okay, I watch Portlandia at times.

Â     Like, okay Ted Leo sans pharmacists/chisel/etc.

Â     Either way, I was getting ready to abandon the awkward snooze-fest and bail, when I saw you in the distance, looming over some swaying yuppies and their toddlers.

Â     I'm not sure if it was the scowl on your face or the reeking sweat that did it for me, but holy shit.

Â     So like a creep, I ambled your way, tripping over lawn chairs and overly groomed skinny-jeanned assholes.

Â     As I creeped on you with wide eyed curiosity and a tinge of lust, the dude in front of you pulled a "yawn" *puts arm over shoulder of the chick next to him* Except instead of actually YAWNING, the dude enthusiastically declared "WOW.

"Â     At which point you bellowed "SAYS YOU AND EVERY GUY AT SHOW TRYING TO GET LAID.

"Â     At that moment, I truly believe a lightning bolt struck my chest.

Â     I watched you pull out your phone and heartily chuckle, muttering something that sounded like "HAH, HULK TWEET THIS.

"Â     Just when I almost, almost had the courage to tap you on your shoulder and ask you your name, you got a text alert.

"Â     And with that, you stormed off.

Â     I'm absolutely kicking myself that I let you get away.

Â     I've been trolling the Internet searching for traces of you, and I'm hoping I find evidence of your existence somehow.

Â     I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

IÂ caught you smelling a pack of cigarettes on the 8th Ave bound L train around noon on Monday, August 6.

Â We both laughed.

You got up and asked me where my "people blockers" wereÂ and if I was getting off where you were, at Union Square.

I hope the quinceaÃ±era went well.

Â I went to the back of the driveway behind a stone barrier and got totally naked and barefoot and got out a bit of lube and a cock ring to make myself rock hard.

Â I was way too turned on.

Â You stood me up and turned me toward the street and fingered my ass while I stroked my cock.

Â You wanted to fuck me but I wouldn't let you because I didn't have condoms- would've been hot- definitely bringing them next time.

Â I got dressed and when I came out there were other guys hanging around who didn't see the "show" but knew something had gone down.

I met you in a outside cafÃ© in Larchmont you invited me to come to the waterfront I was waiting to see my Accountant, I regret not taking you up on the offer, I cannot stop thinking about you, your father Holocaust survivor, get in touch soon.

Â .

Â Then we both laughed at the crazy guy.

You were standing on a porch Â between 2nd and 3rd ave and i think it was on 66th or 67th street.

Â We smiled at each other.

me encantan los hombres que juegan fÃºtbol ya que para mi son muy sexis.

mas k todo busco por un hombre sencillo, descomplicado, k le guste vivir la vida cada dÃ­a , le guste la mÃºsica, bailar, salir a cenar, convivir en familia y viajar.

yo soy una persona k la gusta mucho la mÃºsica,salir a cenar, al cine, cocinar cuando se puede compartir con gente agradable.

In fact, she had recently split up from her fiancÃ©e.

) That, or she reconciled with her fiancÃ©e, or simply was just having a chat and being polite in talking with me.

I'm 90% sure I know this person who said "touchÃ©".

You were wearing a white Sleeveless blouse, olive complexion, yoga mat in bag Â  Black shoes, blue snug jeans I was wearing a light blue button down work shirt blue jeans and grey and white nikes what did m shirt say.

Â     Sat across from you Â in the steam room, and you were then changing right next to me.

Â .

Â I was embarrassed because I looked for too long - you are gorgeous.

Â   I stopped to make a call under some scaffolding, when I turned you walked by.

Nos conocimos en casa de Rick, el sabado por la maÃ±ana, te llamas JerÃ³nimo de PR, tienes el pelo largo y eres guapisimo, te acuerdas que hicimos.

Â .

Â   You:a black man in blue polo and bage pants.

Â   If IOU see this let me know man I like to see you again.

Julianne,  Â  Â Last Thanksgiving marked 10 years since we met.

I did not haveÂ any plans to try to see you but the other day IÂ took the Q 31 to Bell blvd.

and got a cup ofÂ coffee and went back.

Â   It was so nice to reminisce.

Â  Â  It is just so oddÂ to find a woman that does that magic that you did on me.

Â I have come close, but it's so hard to findÂ a good woman.

I hope your happy and doingÂ Â well.

Although sometimes I truly resent ever loving you because itÂ is so hard to forget someone like you.

Then to haveÂ my greatest joy get crushed into my greatest pain, is so much to bare.

Â   I remember asking youÂ to tell me that you don't have the same feelings that I do and I would be content.

Â   Another time I was being facetious and told you that you and your fiancÃ© look so happy together and you responded by saying " things are not always what they seem ".

The day I seenÂ you refuse to hold your fiancÃ©s hand in front of me lead me to think it meant you loved me too.

Â When they kiss my whole body jumps in anxiety wishing it was you and I Â kissing like that.

Â   If things aren't absolutely perfect right now in your life.

And Â I always will.

we so get along great can talk to each other for days, and we share seminarÂ  interests , when ever she wants things between us are close but at times we are so far apart.

You: looks Spanish guy who have a littler lonng hair, in purple t-shirt and gray Â sweet pants looking at your phone and you friend in black t-shirt  You walk in direction to of the Brooklyn bridge.

Â   I know is small chance of you seein this but I try anyway.

Â has anyone told you, you look like a taller, more handsome niel patrick harris.

Â .

Â You had a white shirt and a black dress(skirt.

Â     Is it possible to have a deep connection to a person I've never met.

Â I went to the back of the driveway behind a stone barrier and got totally naked and barefoot and got out a bit of lube and a cock ring to make myself rock hard.

Â I was way too turned on.

Â You stood me up and turned me toward the street and fingered my ass while I stroked my cock.

Â I got dressed and when I came out there were other guys hanging around who didn't see the "show" but knew something had gone down.

Â  .

We looked at each other, I couldnÂ¨t tell if you looked at me as you were wearing glasses.

Ã love yÃ²u.

YÃ²u make me so happy.

Ã do have a ridiculous temper but Ã need yÃ²u tÃ² keep me from flying off the handle.

YÃ²u arÃ© my lÃ³gic.

Ã trust yÃ²u too babay.

Ã love yÃ²u so.

Â     Scene unfinished.

Ã‚Â   I'm not the blond guy in the red jeans who was cruising you real hard.

Ã‚Â   I'm the guy in the short running shorts and tank top.

I know you were interested because I caught you Ã‚Â checking out my ass when you thought I wasn't looking.

Ã‚Â   Well I was, and its all yours if you want it.

Ã‚Â   Hit me back if you get this and tell me what color my shorts were.

I'd love to sit on that stache Ã‚Â ;) ;) .

I'm in love with the most amazing blonde, like I wrote previously howÂ  could I not be.

Love we are both letting things get between us, but all we have to do isÂ  work it out, I know you're nervous because of my playboy ways but you know I couldn't and wouldn't hurt you plus with who if theres no woman better then you.

And It's sucks that you apparently want nothing to do with me, I'm not a guy who worries about women and you know that, you know there are plenty of women chasing me around, you also know I'm a no nonsense kind of guy, so the ones I actually give the time of day to are seriouslyÂ  lucky, but the one who I care about and stole my heart is special.

Like I said you stole myÂ  heart you amazed me, you're adorable,Â  l love a educated woman with a brain I like everything about you, from that gorgeous smile of yours to your sometimes dominating ways, not for nothing but I love seeing you overwhelmed It's priceless, I'm usually the one to calm you down so I enjoy it.

What we have developed is crazy, we have ridiculousÂ  chemistry, that we can read each other so well, It's quite funny because we both try denying when somethings wrong, but the other knows, I know I can be a pain in the ass to deal with however you like it though.

I'mÂ  writing here to let out my feelings, but i also know you read these too.

You said I'd find someone else and he'd break my heart too and then I'd move on again and find someone new and then I'd get married and THAT WAS THAT and that was it  what we were was small and it was nothingÂ   and why was I still crying.

I'm sure you were right, sure you haven't thought of me since, but even if you were right you were also wrongÂ   Because, you see, I loved you more than anything, loved you still even as I love you no more, loved you in a way that makes no sense, has no rhyme, has no reason.

Â I loved you with a depth that has no words, no color or texture, no shape or logic.

Â I loved you until I couldn't love you, and then I loved you more.

Before we collide  Our souls, like black holes  Playing on the windÂ   Frolicking as it blows.

Â   A moment frozen in time  With your hand next to mine  Leaving my heart on fire  With primal desire.

Â  we're both workaholics but that doesn't mean you don't have a second to communicate.

You truly are adorable and amazing , l love everything about you, from that gorgeous smile of yours to your dominating ways, not for nothing but I love seeing youÂ  overwhelmed It's priceless, I'm usually the one to calm you down so enjoy it.

What we have developed is crazy I will admit I never connected with a female the way I have with you , we can read each other so well, It's quite funny because we both try denying when somethings wrong, but the other knows, I know I can be a difficult but you like it when I'm difficult, you just won'tÂ  admit it and I don't want you to either, I just want you stop playing games.

Don't get me wrong I love a women who knowsÂ  how to play the game, you did a great job of notÂ  throwing your self on top of me, but at the same time keeping me wanting you.

I most admit I'm in this situation because I want to be becauseÂ i should have just kissed you that night, but I didn't want to giveÂ in yet.

I guess I'm paying for it now, but if you give me the opportunity again I guarantee you won't regret it   Â  You're just as in love with me as I'm with you, so get off your high horse and realize that next time you're upset and having a hard day your dork teddy bear won't be there for you lean on for support.

Â I got off at union square.

Â We both waited on the steps to the downtown 1 or the local C.

Â We took the C since it arrived first.

Â I waited for you to enter first and we made eyes as you got on the train.

Â You're hot man but too bad I was in a rush and got out the next stop.

Â I tried to touch your arm as I exited but it didn't happen.

Â Would love to meet up.

Â Either for coffee, a drink, or if you want a romp.

L-train Brooklyn boundÂ   Chill film dude with Dreads  Amazing energy man.

QuedÃ© encantado.

Te vi caminando en Union Square hace casi dos meses y hubiese querido hablarte, pero no sabÃ­a como acercarme.

No me queda mÃ¡s opciÃ³n que admirarte desde una distancia.

Â     It just doesn't make any sense.

Â I went to the back of the driveway behind a stone barrier and got totally naked and barefoot and got out a bit of lube and a cock ring to make myself rock hard.

Â I was way too turned on.

Â You stood me up and turned me toward the street and fingered my ass while I stroked my cock.

Â You wanted to fuck me but I wouldn't let you because I didn't have condoms- would've been hot- definitely bringing them next time.

Â I got dressed and when I came out there were other guys hanging around who didn't see the "show" but knew something had gone down.

Â I'd love to see without the scrubs.

Â .

Â   We talked for a few blocks as you and your friend were on the way to a birthday party.

Â   You were so nice and I feel like a dope for not getting your name.

Â .

Â     P.

I get that minority representation in modern film and television is utterly awful, but let's not put Whedon on some sort ofÂ pedestalÂ for his creepiness.

Â     If you really want to call me and my friend "pretentious," try going back and rewatching The Avengers from the perspective of a child playing with action figures in a toybox.

Â     also i make four grand a month making pretty pictures on the computer so i'm pretty fucking sure i know this shit brahski.

And here I thought I had finally found her, the one who isÂ  sane , smart, hardworking, independent, all the other wonderful things I ever told you,which were all real by the way.

I meant everything I ever told you, in fact IÂ  trusted you with my life.

I want to believeÂ  it was all true because at points it seemed very real, but I think I know there's more in your life that you wasn't telling me and i wasn't going to pressure you into telling me.

I just believed you even though I knew it didn't makeÂ  sense.

Â  ex girlfriends that I wasn't even that close with still contact me.

Love I have no idea what went wrong but if it was over the girl nowÂ  then just know she wasn't in the picture, she was a close friend and it wasn't till very recently that something happened.

You know I don't like immature people so not replying, or not giving meÂ  explanation is very immature I would tell you if I thought it couldn't work between us, or if I was over you, but I wouldn't just stop replying like a little kid.

If I'm wrong then I'm sorry baby for overreacting , if your feelings were as you said then I would put this behind me andÂ  happily move on with you.

You: tall and handsome, Â wearing black Levi's, a blue plaid shirt, silver sunglasses, and carrying a brown leather bag.

Â     Me: short, dark blond wearing gray shirt, back pants and heels.

Â     So sorry I didn't slip you a card.

That night, I told someone the good news about my hopeful date with this Ã¼berbabe who I just met and think is so killer, and asked him to please make a floral piece to bring to her.

Â  although we have some pretty darn good communication for not having been in a relationship.

our ridiculous chemistry,Â  allows us to just understand one anther, I can tell when somethings wrong with you, just as you can do the same with me.

Â  Besides you know it your self women like you are hard to replace.

I know things last month got kind of shakey for both of us but that shouldn't of have had been a reasonÂ  for you to get mad, in fact I did what I did because I thught it was going to benefits us.

I have no idea what's going on because every thing was fine but I'm guessing its over some stupid miss understanding, I know theres rumorsÂ that I'm dating a model but trust me there no feelings there, becausev my heart is yours because you stole it.

You checked my actions and called me out and I am Â grateful for that because you put me in my place.

Â  I am truly sorry for any anxiety, fear or stress I may have caused you about 14months ago it was not ok.

things were greatÂ  but I'm guessing its over some stupid miss understanding, I know theres rumorsÂ that I'm dating a model but trust me there no feelings there, because my heart is yours because you stole it.

So you may be mad over that which is silly my love, you're the first one having fun watching women hit on me, but you're sometimes a hard ass , so guess you'reÂ  hurt inside, I know you won't admit to me, because I have to drag things out of you, which I somewhat like by the way, but that's fine baby you can lie to me all you wish but please don't lie to yourself, you would be lying to yourself if you said you had no feelings for me.

You were reading BolaÃ±o on the Brooklyn bound M around 7:30 Friday- you have a beguiling allure.

Me puse estaciÃ³n de tren de Grasmere en el bus 53 con un chico y una chica.

Me sentÃ© a su lado en la parte trasera del autobÃºs.

ParecÃ­a nervioso.

CambiÃ© mi asiento cuando mi amigo me dijo que se siente con ella, pero yo todavÃ­a seguÃ­a mirando hacia atrÃ¡s te de vez en cuando.

Cuando me bajÃ© del autobÃºs y estaba mirando, sonriÃ³.

Dime quÃ© parada bajÃ© alrededor.

YÃ²u found me again.

Ã love yÃ²u so.

YÃ²u pretend tÃ² not remember but yÃ²u remember everything.

Ã love yÃ²u.

I was staring at your hair and face while paying for my food at CosÃ¬.

I'll get the usual clichÃ©s of "I've never done one of these before" and "you'll probably never see this" out of the way.

TouchÃ©.

Â I went to the back of the driveway behind a stone barrier and got totally naked and barefoot and got out a bit of lube and a cock ring to make myself rock hard.

Â I was way too turned on.

Â You stood me up and turned me toward the street and fingered my ass while I stroked my cock.

Â You wanted to fuck me but I wouldn't let you because I didn't have condoms- would've been hot- definitely bringing them next time.

Â I got dressed and when I came out there were other guys hanging around who didn't see the "show" but knew something had gone down.

hola espero leas esto soy la unica persona con la que bailaste me gustaste mucho me gustaria saber mas de ti el numero no me salio no se que paso so si lees este mensaje aver si recuerda mi color de camisa yo estaba con mis amigos y tu con tu amiga no pregunte tu nombre tu estabas parada al lado de la entrada al baÃ±o y wow eres alta espero saber de ti.

Ã dont know why yÃ²u would say that.

YÃ²u know Ã want tÃ² be with yÃ²u.

Ã am dreadfully complicated.

DramÃ¡tical.

Ãllogical.

Ãrrational.

All these things arÃ© horrible character defects but my heart for yÃ²u is pure.

My body for yÃ²u is pure.

Ã love yÃ²u.

Busco una chica que quiera sÃ³lo sexo nada serio.

Que viva serca de dÃ³nde yo vivo.

This individual and I amazingly clicked from the very beginning,Â  we share the same interest and have similar backgrounds and thoughts.

I did that more then once but she'sÂ  guilty as well.

we're both very attractive individuals and So since we haven't hooked up that means I'm single but just because I knew we had strongÂ  feelings I didn't hook up with anyone but she seemed to enjoy watching women hit on me and I enjoyed watching her get mad, if it makes any sense it was as if we where in a relationship.

We just worked on so many different levels every time we spent together I felt this crazyÂ  energy.

But when we would see each other or talk on the phone i couldÂ  sense our feelings where strong then ever.

Mantuvo frotando su pierna sobre la mÃ­a y acariciando mi brazo y codo.

Â¿QuÃ© grupo Ã©tnico son usted y quÃ© parada saliÃ³.

If he is your boyfriend/fiancÃ©e/husband, and you are happily involved, you need not read further.

Â     Is it possible to have a deep connection to a person I've never met.

I dnt see me with another man you are the man of my dreams and you are perfect in every way and i believe we belong together i am willing to do anything to keep you in Ã±y lif.

Â I am worried that if we touched or got any closer that there'd be no turning back.

Danke schÃ¶n for the lovely compliments.

Se sentÃ³ calladamente.

EsperÃ³ algo, pero Ã©l no supieron lo para que.

I want to look past all of your and my faÃ§ades, now and past, and it is god damn hard.

Â I hope with all my heart that you are well and that your troubles will pass you soon.

Â     Yet, today you caused me pain - I've never known you this annoyed or angry before, like my misgiving, whatever it was, was Â utterlyÂ despicable and unforgivable.

Â  I felt so lost and alone, I almost started crying.

Â But I did not.

Â I told myself I should not miss something I never had.

Â I shouldn't miss you or get hurt by you, because you do not exist.

Â   You never did.

Nothing curesÂ this madness like your cruelty, so be mean and cold and distant and if your heart is so, then mine will be free.

Â   Let's meet up ;).

Tantos aÃ±os, Amiga.

For me it was in the blink of an eye entre la mujer aquella que me amo y la niÃ±a que la verdad fue un capricho.

Era casilmente aÃ±o nuevo y pretendi hacerte la propuesta indecente, claro me tiraste el telefono, mandandome pa la mierda.

they make the starving artist clichÃ© seem less romantic.

Â     I was the black guy with a denim jacked with leather sleeves and a green and yellow hat.

All I can remember about u is that u are tall and hotÂ .

I was at Ost CafÃ© getting tea with my two guy friends.

I was sitting kitty-corner from you at a communal table at Iris CafÃ© in the Heights this afternoon at 3/3:30 (ish).

Â     I miss you - you are seldom in my dreams now so I miss seeing you, hearing your voice.

Hey BabÃ©  Are these things real.

You let me borrow your RenÃ© Char book and gave me a Xanax.

Â When you stood up to get off the Bk bound G at Nostrand, I looked up and you turned around apologized for nothing and flashed me a really cute smile.

Â I was reading a computer science book.

Â  Â I definitely regret not striking up a conversation :).

Â  I've never felt compelled to post one of these before, Â your smile was just really cute and genuine and I'd like to know you.

Â  You: black rimmed glasses, carrying a white book tote.

Â I looked at my phone and it was the stroke of midnight.

On Thursday 12/6, we were both atÂ Trattoria Cinque.

On our way out he was walking me back downtown and we passed you and your friends again outsideÂ Trattoria Cinque.

Thy bosom is endearÃ¨d with all hearts  Which I, by lacking, have supposÃ¨d dead;  And there reigns love, and all love's loving parts,  And all those friends which I thought buriÃ¨d.

Â Listen to your heart.

Â Now I am not one to say cheesy sentimental things at all, and I know some of what I have to you is going to sound like that; however, you are ripping yourself apart inside.

Â How did you ever become like this.

Â Listen to yourself.

Â What makes you beautiful is your weakness.

Â The moment you confront yourself, see yourself, and can love yourself, you will feel at peace.

Â Let someone see who you really are.

Â Breakdown and cry for hours, let her console you, and feel her close to you.

Â Follow your instincts and let your true self out.

Â     xoxo.

Â It really hurts: I never thought that I would find someone I could fall hopelessly in love with but I did.

I got on at 4th and Im not sure if you were on the train yetÂ but after a few stops I noticed you walking up and down and all around the train car.

Journal, I caught a glimpse of you, who immediately gave me an uncanny sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu.

At the end of my 2 month summer stay in Vienna, the last nights of enjoyment in Augarten and Oberes Belvedere, reading Schnitzler in Cafe Schwarzenberg on the palatial RingstraÃŸe, I receive an invitation to a masquerade by the Rathaus in Josefstadt.

The party is in an Jugenstil designed residence dating to 1890 on FlorianigaÃŸe.

Outside I light up a cigarette, and find a beautiful 30 year old woman with ties to Vienna and Paris, and after much schmoozing at the party, we go for a few beers at Rhiz Cafe on LerchenfeldstraÃŸe.

Â Â I want to be the exception to your rule.

I wantÂ the chance to amplify that glow.

I had short brown hair, 5'11" to 6', wearing black north face jacket, black top underneathÂ and jeans.

Â  I broke my own rule by believing in you.

Now I honestly don't care becauseÂ  youÂ  literally told me I could have your ass and how great you are on your kneesÂ  and the truth is I love BAD GIRLS like yourself and who know they are bad.

Â So, why am I posting this to craigslist is the question I keep asking myself.

The walls she builds are never thick enough, no matter how much she camouflages the faÃ§ade, makes it appear run-down, worn out, still the bandits and the poets who think they're not bandits and the bandits who think they're poets make their assaults.

What do you win by not contactingÂ  me.

I work only Â½ a block away.

Tall, slim, beautiful, andÂ very elegant.

Forgive the fucking clichÃ© but your smile lit up the room (a room darkened by the worst music I've ever heard).

I remember the thirtieth Super Bowl, Dallas versus Pittsburgh,  I remember Breathe Right Nasal Stripsâ„¢ and Doritosâ„¢ and the spectators in the Phoenix stadium being enlisted in an ad campaign (for what, I don't remember)  I remember Abe turning thirty and thinking to himself, <i>Is this it.

You work part-time at a cafÃ© and have been making my sandwiches for a couple of weeks now.

I was having dinner with my daughter and her fiancÃ©e at a great Italian restaurant on E Tremont Ave.

This is the end, singing a song, "acting like I was part of your property", We separate, Â for now my heart tries to debate".

yes, we shouldn't for so many, many reasons --Â but, I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.

-Bryant park station, me to my soul crushing arch/engineering/waste of time consulting job and you to your place of employment (I hope this does not offend you, but if I had to project I would say that you have CondÃ© Nast written all over you).

You're a tall superb mÃƒÂ©tis, with an amazing very curly hair surrounding the prettiest and sweetest visage I've ever seen.
